# SI Partner Challenges

## Two Root Causes

### Technical Skill Gaps
- Don't know Power Automate Desktop capabilities/syntax
- Don't understand source RPA platform (UiPath/Blue Prism/A360)
- Assume generated code won't work because "it's not how I would write it"
- Raise issues about functionality that actually works fine

### Motivation/Process Issues
- No desire to test tool before raising concerns
- Refuse to try product despite having purchased it
- Want Blueprint to pre-validate every scenario instead of testing themselves
- Elongate sales/implementation cycles by avoiding hands-on evaluation

## Common Patterns

**Sample Bot Syndrome:** Show sample bot, ask "how would you migrate this?" without attempting migration themselves

**Appearance-Based Objections:** Assume migration will fail based on code appearance without functional testing

**Style Over Function:** Technical objections to working functionality because it doesn't match SI's preferred coding style

**Pre-Sales Validation Requests:** Ask for validation on tools already purchased and validated

## Customer Positioning

**Set Expectations:** "Generated code won't look like hand-written code because it needs to work for bots from many different organizations and solutions"

**Redirect to Testing:** "Have you tried it? You have the product and paid for it."

**Validate Through Demo:** Walk through that the product does indeed work as designed

**Educational Approach:** Explain why Blueprint's approach is necessarily different from manual coding

## Mitigation Strategies

### Comprehensive Enablement
- Screen recordings
- Live demos
- Help articles
- LMS certification program

### Self-Service First
- Direct users to existing resources before providing custom support
- Reduces support overhead from unmotivated users

### Pattern Recognition
- Unmotivated SIs rarely become repeat customers (not target segment)
- Focus energy on motivated partners

### Acceptance Strategy
- Some mandated users will reluctantly improve over time
- Can't force motivation through more training materials

## Systemic Issues

**Sales Over-Promising:** Potential disconnect between sales promises ("We can help you optimize broadly") and technical delivery reality

**Motivation Can't Be Forced:** Comprehensive training resources exist, but users must choose to engage

**Support Overhead:** Unmotivated users create disproportionate support burden asking questions answered in available documentation

## Strategic Response

**Not Target Segment:** SI partners with low motivation/technical depth aren't Blueprint's ideal customer profile

**Success with Motivated Partners:** Strong relationships with Avanade, Hitachi, engaged TCS teams

**Enablement Investment:** Continue building resources, but recognize limits of what training can solve
