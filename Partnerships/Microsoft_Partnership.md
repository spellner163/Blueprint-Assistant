# Microsoft Partnership

## Collaboration Patterns

**Frequency:** Quarterly engineering touchpoints, sometimes more frequent

**Roadmap Planning:** Less agile than expected (6-12 month commitments)

**Market Intelligence:** Microsoft proactively seeks Blueprint's field observations

**Customer Reality:** Microsoft's new PAD customers are migration customers, not net-new

## API Development & Integration

### Seamless Export
- Blueprint migrations appear directly in users' Power Automate environments
- Joint API development eliminated manual file upload steps

### SDK Lag Pattern
- Microsoft SDK often trails UI feature releases
- **Workaround:** Direct Robin script mapping when SDK unavailable

## Technical Influence Examples

### Variable Scoping
- **Problem:** PAD only supported global variables, source platforms had scoped variables
- **Blueprint Impact:** Convinced Microsoft to add native support through business case
- **Outcome:** Added to Microsoft roadmap, released in Jan 2026. Customer adoption pending.

### GoTo Actions
- **Problem:** PAD enforced linear workflows, breaking non-linear migrations
- **Blueprint Impact:** Influenced roadmap addition of flexible goto statements
- **Business Case:** Without flexibility, customers rebuild from scratch vs. migrate

### PowerFX Integration
- Ongoing collaboration on expression language support
- Blueprint provides field feedback on integration challenges

## Partnership Value Exchange

**Blueprint provides Microsoft:**
- Real-world migration use cases and blockers
- Enterprise customer feedback on PAD capabilities
- Market insights on RPA → PAD transition patterns

**Microsoft provides Blueprint:**
- Roadmap influence on migration-critical features
- Early access to API updates and beta features
- Co-selling opportunities and migration incentives

## Managing Microsoft Dependency

**Challenge:** Roadmap locks 6-12 months out, difficult for Blueprint to respond quickly to customer blockers

**Mitigation:** Proactive engineering relationship to influence roadmap before customer blockers surface

**Strategy:** Lead with Blueprint workarounds, advocate for native Microsoft solutions long-term
