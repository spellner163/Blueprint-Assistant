# Blueprint Company Overview

## Company
~25-person RPA migration company. Only company in the world doing programmatic RPA migrations - no external docs or competition exist.

## Products
**Migrator (Primary):** Converts bots from UiPath/Blue Prism/A360 → Power Automate Desktop. Uses Common Object Model as translation layer. Target: 80% automated, 20% manual finishing.

**ALC (Blueprint Control):** RPA lifecycle management for Power Automate Desktop estates. Features include auto-documentation, structure/dependency mapping, application analysis, compliance scanning, version awareness/restore, reuse detection, flow intelligence, testing, and collaborative reviews. Platform currently focused on Microsoft PAD only.
- Product is ~2 years old. Zero churn to date — all customers who purchased have renewed. Caveat - very few customers. 
- Almost all ALC sales to date has occurred during or alongside a Migrator engagement. Very few standalone sales exist yet.
- Most heavily used features: auto-documentation, structure diagrams, application analysis (migration-adjacent utility).
- Least used features: opportunity analysis, testing, collaborative reviews (higher-value but require more organizational maturity).
- Common customer reaction: recognize significant value ("Ferrari") but struggle to justify purchase internally without migration context as the trigger.
- Strategic question currently under investigation: can ALC create standalone urgency outside of a migration sales cycle?

## Business Model
- **Customers:** System Integrators (Avanade, Hitachi, TCS) and Fortune 2000 enterprises
- **Microsoft:** Major investor, purchases licenses as migration incentives. Recently offered to subsidize ALC year one for joint customers.
- **Positioning:** "Digital moving company" - preserves source logic faithfully, lets SIs refine post-migration
- **Pricing:** Migration ~$100K/deal; ALC $45-55K/year (Foundation, up to 400 flows), $80-95K/year (Enterprise, 400+ flows)
- **Revenue model:** Migration is project-based with no recurring revenue. ALC is the primary path to durable ARR.

## Team
Martin (CEO), Tony (technical leadership), Dev team of 11. No dedicated sales or marketing — leads historically came through Microsoft. Actively hiring GTM and sales roles.
