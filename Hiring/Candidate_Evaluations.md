# Candidate Evaluations

## TES Candidates

| Candidate | Grade | Recommendation | Key Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Lauren Fulton | B/B+ | **Advance** | 20yr technical L&D, solid across the board, no wow factor. Stumbled to var scoping answer. Best candidate to date. |
| Michelle DeMuth | B- | **Advance** | Second best in a weak pool. Honest, personable, weak adoption answer but proactively raised product longevity risk. Advances relative to field. |
| Daniela F. | — | **No** | Disqualifying behavior: spent ~20 of 50 min asking questions without preface, called investors a "red flag." Cannot read the room — fatal flaw for a customer-facing role. |
| Bhanu | — | **No** | Suspected AI-assisted cheating — went from unable to explain RPA to a suddenly polished answer. Mysterious 20+ second pauses (maybe waiting for GenAI answer?) Integrity failure. Disqualifying regardless of underlying capability. |
| Teena Joy | D | **No** | CS degree + ML minor + active Python tutor, yet couldn't recall variable scoping. Adoption answer: "I don't handle that." Resume credentials likely misrepresented. |
| Michelle S. | TBD | **Interview next week** | Previously passed for no technical depth — Moving to consideration due to other candidates being poor.  |

## Withdrawn / Not Interested
Rachel Stones, Cori Finnegan, Annika Anderson — all withdrew, did not interview.
