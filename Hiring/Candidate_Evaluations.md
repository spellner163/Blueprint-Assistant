# Candidate Evaluations

## TES Candidates

### Teena Joy | Interviewed Dec 2024 | **Recommendation: Skeptical**
- 5yr L&D, CS degree + AI/ML minor, teaches Python freelance
- **Failed variable scoping scenario** - said "I don't recall" global vs. local, offered case sensitivity (wrong). This is CS 101 for someone teaching Python.
- "Complex technical" example was operationally complex, not technically complex
- Low adoption answer relied on manager enforcement, not proactive problem-solving
- **Positive:** Strong communicator, handled fumble gracefully, asked for the answer afterward

### Lauren Fulton | CV Reviewed | **Recommendation: Strong - prioritize**
- 20yr technical training (OpenText 12yr, iManage, IntelliChief)
- Taught taxonomy, SEO, database troubleshooting, automation templates
- Customer-engineering liaison experience
- Consulting practice since 2019 (independent operator)
- **Probe:** How technical did she actually go? Comfortable with 25-person startup?

### Stack Rank (Recruiter Batch)
1. **Rachel Stones** (Veeva) - SQL courses, Amazon non-tech→tech transitions
2. **Lauren Fulton** (IntelliChief) - 20yr technical training
3. **Daniela F.** (Instabase) - CS degree, MIT, former STEM teacher
4. **Cori Finnegan** (Samsara) - GitHub/Amazon/AWS experience. May be overpriced.
5. **Annika Anderson** (Procore) - Early career, need more info

**Passed:** Michelle S. (no technical depth), Jordan Giboney (only 1yr enablement), Debbie Champagne (at Sage since 1997), Jamal Mohammed (would be demotion from Twilio title), Kakali Bhattacharjee (NVIDIA/Google/Apple - unrealistic comp)

## GTM Candidates

### Saswat Patnaik | Interviewed Dec 2024 | **Recommendation: No**
- 11yr digital marketing, B.Tech CS, MBA
- **Failed one-liner test:** "By using Microsoft Power Automation, you can do stuff faster, saves time and cost... makes things faster." Described PAD, not Blueprint. Generic fluff.
- Never used products he marketed - always translated PM/sales docs
- Took 15min of 30min interview asking questions
- Tony aligned: "middle of the road, not a rock star"
