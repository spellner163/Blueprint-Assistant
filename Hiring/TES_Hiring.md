# Technical Enablement Specialist Hiring

## Role
Bridge gap between non-technical CS team and Product. Lead live training, create enablement content, handle moderately technical customer questions without escalation.

**Must have:** Strong L&D background + ability to pick up technical RPA concepts within 3-4 months.
**Not required:** RPA development experience. Won't build processes from scratch.

## Interview Structure (30 min)

### 1. Technical Foundation (8-10 min)
Techical probing. Example:
- "Tell me about a time you had to learn a technical product and teach non-technical users"

### 2. Problem-Solving Scenario (12-15 min)
Techical problem solving. Example:
**Setup:** "Source platform allows variables scoped to subprocesses. Target platform (PAD) makes all variables global."
**Scenario:** "Customer says migrated bot isn't working. They had variable 'counter' in three independent subprocesses. Now producing wrong results. What's happening?"
**Expected insight:** The three counters are colliding - all now reference the same global variable, overwriting each other.
**Follow-up if answered technically:** "How would you explain this to a citizen developer with no programming background?"
**Good analogy:** Three people sharing one notepad vs. each having their own copy.

### 3. Other (5 min)
Depending on how conversation went, some example questions:
- "How do you handle low adoption of E-Learning?"
- "When ramping up on a new complicated or technical domain, how do you learn it before you teach it?"

## Example of What Good Looks Like
**Weak:** "It wasn't up to me to handle low adoption, it was up to managers to enforce."
**Strong:** "While typically something that is handled by managers, I always approach adoption metrics with curiousity. If they are low, I would source feedback as to why. Maybe we need to gamify it, maybe it's too dense. An investigation is required to improve the material and I would need figure it out."

## Sourcing Criteria
- Can cite technical training material they had created in the past
- Red flags: not technical enough, has a "that's not my job" mindset, low curiosity
