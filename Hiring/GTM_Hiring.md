# GTM Lead Hiring

## Role
Build marketing function for ALC product. Lead gen, campaigns, website, content. Blueprint has done zero marketing historically - leads came through Microsoft.

**Must have:** Can internalize domain enough to craft resonant positioning for technical buyers.
**Not just:** Campaign executor who needs messaging fed to them.

## Interview Structure (30 min)

### 1. Past Domain Depth (7 min)
Example:
- "When crafting campaigns and messaging at [previous company], how deeply did you understand the product? Translating what product/sales gave you, or getting into the weeds yourself?"

Listen for: Did they *choose* to go deep?

### 2. Live Synthesis Test (15 min)
Example:
**Setup:** "Enterprises have millions invested in UiPath/Blue Prism bots. Microsoft pushing Power Automate. Rebuilding thousands of bots manually is expensive and slow. Blueprint programmatically migrates - we're a translation layer. Buyers are enterprises or SIs doing the work."
**Question:** "Write a one-liner for an SI evaluating Blueprint vs. rebuilding manually. Think out loud."
**Follow-up:** "SI pushes back: 'automated migration sounds great, but I don't trust output quality - we'd spend just as long fixing issues.' How do you respond?"

## What Good Looks Like
**Weak:** "Blueprint helps you migrate faster, saving time and cost."
**Strong:** "Your SI team quotes 18 months to rebuild 2,000 bots manually. Blueprint gets you 80% there in weeks - developers finish the last 20% instead of starting from zero."

## Sourcing Criteria
- B2B SaaS marketing for technical products
- Can point to positioning they personally developed
- Red flags: Only campaign execution, never used products they marketed, can't summarize
