# Interview Practices

## Core Philosophy
- **Don't lead the witness.** Clear questions deserve clear answers. If they need the question rephrased to get there, that's signal.
- **Test instincts, not just knowledge.** How they interpret ambiguous questions reveals how they think.
- **It's their time.** If candidate goes off the rails or rambles, not my job to bring them back to the topic. It's feedback on how they think
- **Credentials ≠ competence.** Example: Variable scoping is CS 101. If someone with a CS degree teaching Python can't recall it, that's disqualifying.

## Green Flags
- Asks clarifying questions before answering
- Acknowledges what they don't know
- Shows curiosity about problem space
- Summarizes concisely
- Specific examples over generalities

## Red Flags
- Freezes on unfamiliar scenarios
- Deflects to "I'd escalate that"
- Rambles without getting to the point
- Takes disproportionate interview time asking questions (self-awareness issue)

## Fluff vs. Substance
Two responses can look similar but differ dramatically:
- **Fluff:** Generic language, buzzwords, no specific insight
- **Substance:** Demonstrates actual understanding, addresses real concerns, specific and actionable

People without domain knowledge often can't distinguish. That's why technical interviewers matter.
