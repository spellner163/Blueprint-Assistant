# Blueprint Product Backlog & Prioritization Framework

## Current Three-Fold Prioritization Focus

### 1. PowerFX Expression Language Upgrade
**Initial Vision:** Upgrade expression language in Power Automate Desktop to utilize PowerFX for better functionality

**Investigation Results:** 
- PowerFX appears "shoehorned" into PAD without cohesion with existing actions
- **Critical Limitation:** Standard PAD data table actions don't interact properly with PowerFX expressions
- PowerFX treats PAD data tables as custom objects rather than native data tables
- **Impact:** Functionality failures in basic use cases

**Current Status:** Likely to be reduced in priority based on technical limitations discovered

**Decision Framework:** Technical investigation revealed fundamental integration issues that limit practical value

### 2. AI Feature Portfolio Evaluation

Two AI features under consideration, both with mixed market validation:

#### 2A. Agentic AI Middleware ("Add to Agent" Feature)
**Concept:** Automatically convert RPA processes into agent tools with context and utterances

**Technical Approach:**
- Target: Microsoft Copilot initially  
- Expansion capability: HTTP request triggers + Power Automate cloud for other agent platforms
- Handles: Context generation, utterance creation, agent integration automatically

**Market Response:** **Lower interest than expected**
- Enterprise customers show limited enthusiasm
- Positioning challenge: May not solve significant customer pain point

#### 2B. AI Candidate Analysis Extension (Assess Analytics Enhancement)  
**Concept:** Grade PAD components (subflows, code segments) for AI agent suitability, specifically human-in-the-loop scenarios

**Technical Challenge:** Identifying where human-in-the-loop exists in RPA processes
**Target Analysis:** Subflows and code snippets rather than entire flows

**Market Response:** **Higher interest from target segments**
- Enterprise customers cite as "much more interesting" than middleware approach
- **SI Partner Feedback:** Manual hookup "not that much work" but analysis "could save lots of time/effort and help profitability" 
- **Value Proposition:** Help identify what's worth moving vs. comprehensive migration

## Market Validation Insights

### Customer Feedback Patterns
**Middleware Feature:** Solves a problem that may not be painful enough to pay for
**Analysis Feature:** Addresses real business optimization need (time/effort savings, profitability improvement)

### SI Partner Perspectives
- Manual integration work is manageable 
- **High value in decision support:** What should we move vs. what should we keep?
- Profitability impact more compelling than convenience features

## Strategic Decision Considerations

### Evidence-Based Prioritization Challenges
**Current State:** Neither AI feature has compelling evidence for strong market demand
**Risk:** Building AI features that look innovative but don't solve real problems
**Philosophy Alignment:** "Clarity over confusion" - avoid "fluffy" AI features

### Resource Allocation Framework
**Competing Priorities:** PowerFX investigation, two AI features, existing product maintenance
**Evidence Threshold:** What level of customer validation required before committing engineering resources?
**Market Timing:** Balance between being early to AI opportunities vs. building proven value

## Strategic Analysis: Business Model vs Technical Feasibility

### Customer Segmentation Insights
**Middleware Feature (Low Market Interest):**
- **Target Market:** End clients (historically not Blueprint's customer base)
- **Business Challenge:** Would require new market entry and sales channel development
- **Development Status:** Already built to significant degree, minimal additional work needed

**Analytics Feature (Higher SI Interest):**
- **Target Market:** Service Integrators (Blueprint's existing customer base and relationships)
- **Business Advantage:** Leverages existing sales channels and customer relationships
- **Development Challenge:** Conservative estimate of "many months of work" with technical uncertainty

### Technical Feasibility Research Needs

**Human-in-the-Loop Detection Challenge:**
Current hypothesis requires validation of two potential scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Explicit Human Interaction Actions (Potentially Detectable)**
- **Examples:** Message input boxes, dialog interactions where user must provide input mid-process
- **Technical Feasibility:** Could potentially identify these through action analysis
- **Market Reality:** Sean's assessment suggests this is "extremely rare" in actual RPA development

**Scenario 2: Implicit Process Handoffs (Likely Undetectable)**
- **Pattern:** Bot runs to completion → human takes over → second bot runs
- **Technical Challenge:** No explicit markers in code indicating handoff points
- **Detection Difficulty:** "Borderline impossible" - requires inferring business logic intent
- **Market Reality:** Believed to be much more common approach

**Key Research Question:** Which scenario represents actual market patterns in human-in-the-loop RPA?

**Critical Insight:** If only explicit interactions are detectable, and these are "extremely rare," the feature may not provide sufficient value to justify months of engineering investment.

**Research Approaches Considered:**
1. **Pattern analysis on existing migrations** - Analyze Blueprint's migration database for frequency of explicit human interaction actions
2. **SI partner interviews** - Direct customer research on human-in-the-loop design patterns  
3. **Technical feasibility spike** - 1-2 week developer investigation on detection approaches using real customer code samples

**Current Assessment:** Analytics feature likely not viable if limited to rare explicit interaction scenarios

### Strategic Inflection Point Analysis

**Product Maturity Context:**
- **Migration Platform:** Core functionality complete, focus shifts to optimization and maintenance
- **Market Position:** Strong SI relationships established
- **Resource Allocation:** 1-2 developers available for experimental features per release

**Strategic Direction Options:**
1. **Market Expansion:** Leverage existing middleware capability to target direct enterprise customers (new market segment)
2. **Relationship Deepening:** Focus experimental resources on Assess enhancements or Migration optimizations for existing SI customers
3. **Feature Innovation:** Continue pursuing AI capabilities despite mixed market validation

**Decision Framework Considerations:**
- **Technical feasibility must precede major resource commitment**
- **Business model alignment (SI focus) vs. technical complexity trade-offs**  
- **Core platform maturity creates opportunity for strategic pivots**
- **Limited engineering capacity requires high-conviction feature bets**

## Next Steps for Backlog Prioritization

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **PowerFX Decision:** Finalize priority reduction based on integration limitations
2. **Human-in-the-Loop Research:** Validate technical feasibility before analytics feature commitment
3. **Strategic Direction Assessment:** Market expansion vs. existing relationship deepening

**Future Reference:**
- **Analytics Feature:** Maintain as potential future opportunity pending technical research outcomes
- **Middleware Capability:** Consider market expansion applications with existing SI customer introduction model
