# AI Competitive Risk Assessment for ALC

## Verdict
AI poses no meaningful near-to-medium term existential threat to ALC. The primary competitive threat is Microsoft building governance natively into PAD.

## Why AI Is Neutralized Near-Term

RPA is notoriously underdocumented and constantly evolving. Public AI models are trained on public data — which for RPA platform behavioral differences is sparse, outdated, and frequently wrong. Blueprint's real moat is its proprietary corpus of real migration data: thousands of actual bots, real edge cases, real platform behaviors across the world's most complex automation estates. No public model has access to this, and it widens over time.

ALC's most defensible features require longitudinal estate awareness — version history, change impact analysis, dependency tracking over time, compliance drift detection. These require having been embedded in a customer's environment continuously accumulating data. AI cannot replicate this without that foundation.

## The Real Threat: Microsoft

Microsoft building PAD governance natively is more proximate and more dangerous than AI disruption. It would leverage Microsoft's existing distribution, compress Blueprint's differentiation, and eliminate the primary inbound channel simultaneously. The correct defensive response is to get so deeply embedded at shared customers that Blueprint becomes unavoidable infrastructure — which is also why Microsoft's current offer to subsidize ALC year-one should not be deprioritized.

## Long-Term Watch (3-5 Year Horizon)
If AI models improve at ingesting proprietary codebases, ALC's analytical features (documentation, structure mapping) face some compression. The right response is ensuring Blueprint's estate data becomes the foundation that AI is built on top of, not replaced by.
