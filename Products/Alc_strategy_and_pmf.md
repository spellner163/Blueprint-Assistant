# ALC Strategy and Product-Market Fit

## What We Know
- Zero churn in two years — every customer who purchased ALC has renewed. Genuine signal.
- ALC has only ever been sold during or alongside a Migrator engagement. No standalone sales exist.
- Post-migration, customers keep ALC to manage and understand their evolving PAD estate — legs exist outside migration, but the entry point has always been migration.
- Most heavily used features: auto-documentation, structure diagrams, application analysis (migration-adjacent utility).
- Least used features: opportunity analysis, testing, collaborative reviews (higher value, require more organizational maturity).
- Blueprint has no sales team. Martin handles outbound; Microsoft handles inbound.

## The Core PMF Question
Can ALC create urgency in a buyer who is not currently in a migration sales cycle? This is the single most important unknown. All strategic decisions downstream are premature until there is data on this.

## The Ferrari Problem
Customers consistently recognize value in ALC but cannot create internal urgency to justify the purchase independently. The product is comprehensive but no single feature in isolation appears to be something a company would pay $45-55K/year to solve on its own. Working hypothesis: Blueprint has built a comprehensive list of nice-to-haves that don't yet solve any urgent, budget-unlocking problems.

## Key Strategic Tensions

**Identity contradiction:** Blueprint cannot simultaneously be a migration company and a standalone control company without a clear sequencing strategy. "ALC is an expansion of Migrator" contradicts the ambition to sell it independently.

**ICP/pricing misalignment:** Heads of Automation and CoE leads (proposed ICP) often lack budget authority despite owning business-critical processes. The people who feel the pain and the people who control the budget are frequently not the same person. $45-55K may also be priced for mid-market friction reduction while the described ICP is enterprise — these aren't aligned.

**Microsoft posture:** Microsoft recently offered to subsidize ALC year-one to drive joint customer adoption. Deliberately deprioritizing that channel to build an independent motion leaves significant distribution on the table and carries real relationship risk. Microsoft could also build PAD governance natively at any time — deep embedment via Microsoft's channel is actually the best protection against that outcome, not independence from it.

**ARR projections:** 25 customers in FY2027 assumes a GTM motion that doesn't exist yet. Blueprint has sold to a handful of ALC customers in two years with Microsoft's help. The projections require honest stress-testing before being treated as a plan.

## The Early Adopter Program
Acquiring 5-10 customers at $0 before June 2026 is the right move — it's the only mechanism to actually answer the core PMF question. It must be treated as a genuine pass/fail test, not a validation phase before an already-decided pivot.

**What to measure:** Not just what customers use, but what triggered the session, what problem they were trying to solve, and whether urgency existed independently of Blueprint being available through a migration relationship.

- **Pass:** Customers outside migration context open Blueprint because something is on fire. Invest behind standalone GTM.
- **Fail (informative):** Customers use Blueprint as a useful companion, not an urgent solution. Use findings to identify what to build next to create that urgency.

## Binding Constraint
The GTM hire is the prerequisite for everything above. Without it there is no capacity to run the early adopter program properly, and no standalone sales motion can exist. This hire is not just a sales investment — it's the unlock for answering Blueprint's most important strategic question.

## Recommended Sequencing
1. Prioritize GTM hire.
2. Run early adopter program as a genuine PMF test with a structured research agenda.
3. Use findings to inform product investment — what transforms nice-to-haves into urgent problem-solvers.
4. Revisit Blueprint Control strategy, positioning, ICP, and pricing once real signal exists.
